     b.3. Key success factors
           The key factors of success of the Amazon are Automation and real-time data which improve efficiency, AI-driven forecasting to optimized inventory management, Integration across department to ensure smooth data flow. And lastly Customer-centric approach that fucoses to fast delivery and customer fullfillment.
     b.4. outcomes & impact
           The Amazon outcomes they have fast delivery and a fast flow of data  to fullfill the wants of the customer, and the impact they invite more customer to use Amazon for their shoping.
C. case study 2: Failed Enterprise System Implementation
     c.1. company overview (Reason for implementing the enterprise system)
           The company want to opitimize invertory control, automated control fulfillment and logistics efficiency so they use WMS (warehouse management system) but it was a disasters because of poor operation and the delivery times.
     c.2. implementation process & challenges
           The challenges is that applying new system will result to system integration issues where there are giltches and mismatches pf information.
     c.3. Key failure factors
           The key failure factors that the Amazon has face operational disruptions resulted to delays and incorrect stocks tracking and the employment training gaps led to systems inefficiencies.
     c.4. outcomes & consequences
          The failed system implementation led to delayed of deliveries incorrect inventory tracking and financial loss due to unable to track the system. Poor system integration caused order fulfillment issues while uneducated employee because of lack of training contributed to inefficiencies.
D. Comparative analysis - create a table for both case study 1 & 2)
     D.1 Similarities & Differences
          The amazon company what to improve their logistics and inventory systems. So they apply system integration to support their needs in system and to support the needs of there customer. While the differences in not applying the system integration their company have lot of problems and their system.
        d.2. Critical Success vs. Failure Factors
             Amazon have succeeded in enterprise system implementation because of their strategic planning and employee training ensuring that seamless integration and efficiency. In contrast the Company X failed due to poor planning and system glitches leading to poor operational disruptions.
     d.3. Key Takeaways & Lessons Learned - include the following questions;
            1. What did the successful case do right? - Amazon ensured success by prioritizing strategic planning and using the system integration leading to system adoption in the modern era, real-time data integration to know the needs of the customer, and operational efficiency.
            2. What went wrong in the failed case? - The failed case Faced system integration issues due to poor planning about there system, lack of employee training to know the needs of the system and frequent glitches to their records, datas, and system this thing id resulting in data mismatches and operational disruptions.
            3. How can future implementations avoid similar failures? - Future implementations should emphasize thorough planning because these will help the company to know their future risk and by making this step they are one step ahead of the risk.
